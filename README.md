# Yggdrasil Routing Demo
Blink some lights on some raspberry pis... gaze into the mesh.

# Ingredients
* Some Raspberry Pis... 4 or 3b will do, but 3 and lower will have pretty slow speed on Yggdrasil network (encryption requires CPU.)
* Some SD cards... one to a pi.
* USB -> Ethernet adapters. The pi only comes with one port, and that's not going to cut it for the demo. Pick up a few converters so that you can make multiple links on a single device.
* Cases... Hit us up in Riot and we can connect you with them on the cheap. We've got the means of 3D print production at our disposal.

# Prep Work
Flash the SD cards with Raspbian headless.
* We use [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/)
* You can download Raspbian [here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)
